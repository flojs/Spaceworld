Spaceworld
==========

This is an openGl program I developed in the Masters course Computer Graphics taught at The University of Adelaide, Semester 1, 2013.

It features a spacy looking world where the user by keyboard input controls the spaceships acceleration. 
The focus was on the use of shaders and the code include implementation of a skybox, hemisphere lightning, a chase camera, depth cuing(fog) and terrain genneration. 

The used models are created by Simeon Nasilowski.
